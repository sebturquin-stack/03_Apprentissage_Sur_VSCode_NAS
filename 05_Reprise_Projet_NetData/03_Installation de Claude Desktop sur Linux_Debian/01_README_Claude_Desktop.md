# Claude Desktop for Linux

This project provides build scripts to run Claude Desktop natively on Linux systems. It repackages the official Windows application for Linux distributions, producing `.deb` packages (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` packages (Fedora/RHEL), distribution-agnostic AppImages, an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-appimage) for Arch Linux, and a Nix flake for NixOS.

**Note:** This is an unofficial build script. For official support, please visit [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com). For issues with the build script or Linux implementation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues) in this repository.

**Documentation:** Full docs at [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md). Release history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Contributing: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Security reports: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

> **⚠️ APT migration notice (April 2026)**
>
> The APT/DNF repo moved to `pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev` (#493) — binaries are now served from GitHub Releases via a Cloudflare Worker so they don't hit the 100 MB per-file push cap on `gh-pages`. **DNF users are unaffected.** APT users on the legacy `aaddrick.github.io` sources.list will see a scheme-downgrade error on `apt update`. [One-line `sed` fix](#migrating-from-the-old-aaddrickgithubio-url).

---

## Features

- **Native Linux Support**: Run Claude Desktop without virtualization or Wine
- **MCP Support**: Full Model Context Protocol integration
  Configuration file location: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **System Integration**:
  - Global hotkey support (Ctrl+Alt+Space) - works on X11 and Wayland (via XWayland)
  - System tray integration
  - Desktop environment integration

## Installation

### Using APT Repository (Debian/Ubuntu - Recommended)

Add the repository for automatic updates via `apt`:

```bash
# Add the GPG key
curl -fsSL https://pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/claude-desktop.gpg

# Add the repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/claude-desktop.gpg arch=amd64,arm64] https://pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/claude-desktop.list

# Update and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install claude-desktop
```

Future updates will be installed automatically with your regular system updates (`sudo apt upgrade`).

### Using DNF Repository (Fedora/RHEL - Recommended)

Add the repository for automatic updates via `dnf`:

```bash
# Add the repository
sudo curl -fsSL https://pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev/rpm/claude-desktop.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/claude-desktop.repo

# Install
sudo dnf install claude-desktop
```

Future updates will be installed automatically with your regular system updates (`sudo dnf upgrade`).

#### Migrating from the old `aaddrick.github.io` URL

If you installed claude-desktop before April 2026, your repo config points at `https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian`. That URL now auto-redirects to `pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev` — DNF follows the redirect transparently, but **apt refuses it as a security downgrade**, so `apt update` fails. Update your sources list to the new URL:

```bash
# APT (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo sed -i 's|https://aaddrick\.github\.io/claude-desktop-debian|https://pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev|g' \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/claude-desktop.list
sudo apt update

# DNF (Fedora/RHEL) — optional refresh; the old URL still works but pointing directly at the new host is cleaner
sudo curl -fsSL https://pkg.claude-desktop-debian.dev/rpm/claude-desktop.repo \
  -o /etc/yum.repos.d/claude-desktop.repo
```

Background: binaries for recent releases are no longer committed to the `gh-pages` branch — `.deb` files grew past GitHub's 100 MB per-file cap (#493). The new URL is fronted by a small Cloudflare Worker that serves the existing metadata directly and 302-redirects package downloads to the corresponding GitHub Release asset. Bandwidth and package bytes still come from GitHub; the Worker just handles the routing.

### Using AUR (Arch Linux)

The [`claude-desktop-appimage`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-appimage) package is available on the AUR and is automatically updated with each release.

```bash
# Using yay
yay -S claude-desktop-appimage

# Or using paru
paru -S claude-desktop-appimage
```

The AUR package installs the AppImage build of Claude Desktop.

### Using Nix Flake (NixOS)

Install directly from the flake:

```bash
# Basic install
nix profile install github:aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian

# With MCP server support (FHS environment)
nix profile install github:aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian#claude-desktop-fhs
```

Or add to your NixOS configuration:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.claude-desktop.url = "github:aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, claude-desktop, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          nixpkgs.overlays = [ claude-desktop.overlays.default ];
          environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.claude-desktop ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Using Pre-built Releases

Download the latest `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/releases).

### Building from Source

See [docs/building.md](docs/building.md) for detailed build instructions.

## Configuration

Model Context Protocol settings are stored in:
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For additional configuration options including environment variables and Wayland support, see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Troubleshooting

Run `claude-desktop --doctor` for built-in diagnostics that check common issues (display server, sandbox permissions, MCP config, stale locks, and more). It also reports cowork mode readiness — which isolation backend will be used, and which dependencies (KVM, QEMU, vsock, socat, virtiofsd, bubblewrap) are installed or missing.

For additional troubleshooting, uninstallation instructions, and log locations, see [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

- **[ProfFlow](https://github.com/ProfFlow)** for re-fixing the RPM repodata signing regression by appending `!` to the keyid passed to `gpg --default-key`, forcing `repomd.xml` to be signed by the primary key instead of the auto-selected signing subkey (#566)
- **[jslatten](https://github.com/jslatten)** for fixing the KDE Plasma Wayland launcher-grouping bug by setting `pkg.desktopName` in the packaged `app.asar`'s `package.json`, format-conditional so deb/rpm get `claude-desktop.desktop` and AppImage gets `io.github.aaddrick.claude-desktop-debian.desktop` (#562)

- **[phelps-matthew](https://github.com/phelps-matthew)** for fixing `CLAUDE_QUIT_ON_CLOSE=1` to actively quit via `app.quit()` instead of relying on the bundled handler that hardcodes hide-to-tray on Linux, with thorough root cause analysis and alternatives evaluation (#624, #623)
- **[dubreal](https://github.com/dubreal)** for `--password-store` keyring detection that probes D-Bus for kwallet6 / gnome-libsecret at startup, fixing session persistence on KDE Plasma and other desktops where Electron's `safeStorage` was unavailable (#611, #593)
- **[JustinJLeopard](https://github.com/JustinJLeopard)** for detecting missing electron binaries after Node 24's `extract-zip` silently no-ops, with an `unzip` fallback that recovers from the `@electron/get` cache (#631, #584)
- **[tkrag](https://github.com/tkrag)** for diagnosing and fixing the X11 window-raise-on-hover bug under sloppy/focus-follows-mouse WMs, tracing the upstream `webContents.focus()` → `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` path through three iterations of review (#589, #416)
- **[maplefater](https://github.com/maplefater)** for re-anchoring the `addTrustedFolder` `.asar` guard on the `async addTrustedFolder(…)` method declaration after upstream 1.10628.x folded the log call into a comma-expression, keying both the parameter extraction and the injection point off the unminified method name so they can't drift apart (#685)
- **[MitchSchwartz](https://github.com/MitchSchwartz)** for finding the second `app.asar` file-drop path — the `existsSync()` branch in the second-instance argv collector that #640 never guarded — and rejecting `.asar` paths there so the app no longer prompts to attach its own bundle on every taskbar reopen (#669, #668)
- **[LiukScot](https://github.com/LiukScot)** for making the tray rebuild mutex trailing-edge so the startup dark-theme icon no longer latches black, and restoring the in-place `setImage` fast-path after upstream changed the context-menu wiring to a prebuilt menu object (#680, #679)
- **[sabiut](https://github.com/sabiut)** for extending the headless launch smoke test to the deb and rpm artifacts — previously only the AppImage actually booted in CI — with a shared `run_launch_smoke_test` helper that catches startup-only regressions on the formats they break (#671, #670)
